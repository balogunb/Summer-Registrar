git clone git@github.com:vasschrys/Summer_Project_2019.git
yes


Converstaion with wassim:
I actually wouldnt recommend you use the coursechief approach because it relies on the registrar providing a csv file of courses (that they can easily generate from banner but still take a long to time to respond every time)

what I recommend you do is directly parse the banner publicly accessible page by yourself
using a script (depending on which language you're using)
i do react with next.js on the ui side and express.js on the api side
and i use atom or vscode for IDE
if you're going javascript i recommend mongodb but if you wanna use sql that works too


This is the link wassim sent me the page is https://bannerselfservice.lafayette.edu/pls/bprod/bwckschd.p_disp_dyn_sched
